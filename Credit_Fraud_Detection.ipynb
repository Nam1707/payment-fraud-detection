The dataset contains 284,807 transactions, only 492 of which are labeled fradulent, or 0.172%. Due to confidentiality, this dataset has been transformed from its original form and only provides time and amount of each transaction along with 28 principal components of the original features obtained by PCA. Some information is inevitably lost during this transformation which limits how well any algorithm can do on this dataset compared to similar non-transformed datasets. It also renders feature engineering virtually irrelevant, as I discuss below in more detail.\n"

    "Before we build our model, we need to choose an evaluation metric to measure the performance of different models with. For reasons explained below, I will evaluate models based on the highest recall rate they can acheive subject to precision being above a given minimum, say 5%. The idea behind this evaluation metric is that we want to focus on and maximize recall (probability of detecting fraud). But since higher recall (i.e. a more sensitive classifier) will inevitably result in lower precision (more false positives) we also want to make sure that precision does not get too low. So, we preset a level of precision and then try to maximize the probability of detecting fraudulent transactions, that is, the recall rate. I will call this metric **Conditional Recall**."

    "I will briefly explain the reason for this choice, and why Conditional Recall is a better evaluation metric in this context than more commonly used alternatives such as AUC, PRAUC and F-score.\n",
    "\n",
    "In choosing the evaluation metric we need to take two important features of the problem into account:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The evaluation metric needs to be robust to class imbalance and provide a reasonable measure of performance in the presence of this highly skewed class distribution (as only 0.172% of transactions are fraudulent)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. It needs to incorporate the fact that false negatives (failing to detect fraud) are more costly than false positives (labeling a legal transaction as fraud).\n",
    "\n",
    "The first consideration rules out some common metrics, such as accuracy and AUC (area under ROC curve) as these are not robust to class imbalance (Davis and Goadrich 2006). On the other hand, precision and recall have been shown to be robust to highly skewed class distributions and that is why a metric based on these statistics is more suitable for the present context.\n",
    "\n",
    "PRAUC (area under precision-recall curve) and F-score are two of the most commonly used metrics that combine precision and recall into one single metric. However, they do not satisfy the second criterion. PRAUC gives the same weight to the performance of a classifier at all levels of precision and recall, whereas we care more about performance at high recall rates. In other words, a classifier with very high precision at low levels of recall can acheive a very high PRAUC score while it is practically useless for fraud detection purposes. F-score is more flexible in that we can give more weight to recall but I will not use this metric as it requires making ad-hoc assumptions about the context of the problem and the relative costs of false positives and false negatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, Conditional Recall allows us to focus on improving the ability of the algorithm to detect fraud (i.e., its recall) in a transparent and easy-to-interpret way, while maintaining a decent level of precision.\n",

    "To address the extreme class imbalance in the data, I will use two different preprocessing techniques. For the XGBoost algorithm, I simply reweight the instances of the positive class (fraudulent transactions) by the class imbalance ratio. In the case of Logistic regression (one of the algorithms to which I will compare XGBoost), I use the **Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE)**. SMOTE balances the class distribution by creating new synthetic instances of the minority class.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, I do not perform any further feature engineering (beyond rescaling for Logistic regression) for the following two reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. There are no missing values in this dataset and hence no need for imputing missing values. All variables are continuous numerical values.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. XGBoost is an ensemble learning algorithm whose individual learning units are decision trees and trees have two favorable features which, again, render feature engineering unnecessary. First, decision trees are invariant to monotonic transformations of features (e.g. scaling or polynomial transformations). Second, they can inherently capture and model interactions between features. So, we do not need to manually create feature interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. As I mentioned above, the PCA transformation makes it impossible to use our background knowledge about the features to create new ones. Moreover, we do not need to worry about feature correlation as principal components are, by construction, orthogonal and therefore uncorrelated with one another.\n",

Tuning by cross validation: Given the relatively large number of hyper-parameters of XGBoost, I will use Bayesian hyper-parameter tuning (which is more efficient than grid or random search), with (stratified) K-fold cross validation to choose the set of hyper-parameters that acheive the highest cross validated Conditional Recall score.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Thresholding: The tuned classifier from step (1) is able to predict a probability score for any given example. In order to classify an example we need to choose a probability threshold above which examples are labeled as positive (fraud). The standard practice is to set the threshold at 0.5. However, given the relative importance of recall over precision, we can use empirical thresholding (Sheng and Ling, 2006) to tune the trade off between precision and recall and possibily acheive a higher recall rate by choosing an appropriate classification threshold.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Training and testing: I will train the model on the entire training set and evaluate its performance on the test set using the Conditional Recall metric discussed above.\n",

In order to compare different models (e.g. XGBoost vs Logistic Regression) one would ideally use nested cross validation. However, this is computationally very expensive.

At every iteration, it evaluates the performance of the model so far on a validation set. It keeps training until the error on this validation set, which I will call early stopping set, fails to improve for a given number of iterations. This means that we are optimizing the number of trees as we train the model. But that also means that we cannot use that same set to evaluate the model. Otherwise we would overfit (the number of trees parameter) and the cross validation score will be biased upwards. That is why we need a separate validation set for early stopping, in addition to the (rotating) validation set used in cross validation.\n",

At every training iteration, it evaluates the algorithm's performance on a validation set (`X_early_stop` and `y_early_stop` here) and stops training when the resulting score (measured by the metric provided through `eval_metric`) does not improve for a given number of consecutive rounds (set via `early_stopping_rounds` argument). In other words, the training stops just before training and validation error start to diverge, beyond which we would be likely to overfit."
